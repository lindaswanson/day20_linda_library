The Library

You've been contracted to write a piece of software for the local library.
The software needs to meet the following requirements:

- Each book listing should include the title, author, genre (Fiction, Non-Fiction, etc.), length,
and checked-in/checked-out status

- Librarians should be able to:
a.) add books to the inventory
b.) remove books from the inventory
c.) view a list of all the books in the library
d.) view a list of all the books in a given genre
e.) search for a book by title or author
